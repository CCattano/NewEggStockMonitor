# New Egg Stock Monitor

Wrote this to monitor NewEgg's stock of the AMD Ryzen9 5900X CPU

I have email, sms, and browser notifications setup via nowinstock.com for Amazon and B&H's listing of the 5900X

I have [BirdBot](https://nateskicks13.gitbook.io/bird-bot/) monitoring BestBuy.com's listing

That left NewEgg, I had no way to monitor that as they don't offer an in-stock email notification themselves.

This solved that problem for me.
